                    One of the biggest arenas for designers is residential design, or the interiors of spaces in which people live. 
                    This can include houses, apartments, condos, and anywhere else where people reside. 
                    The architect may build the house, but it's the designer's job to make it a home.

                    Residence: it's a place where people live. 
                    Therefore, a residential designer's primary focus is creating a livable space. 
                    This means that residential designs needs to be comfortable and usable. Think of what you use your home for. 
                    It's where you relax, cook, and eat. 
                    It may be where you entertain close friends or small groups of guests. 
                    You may have a home office for work.

                    Residential design is the design of the interior of private residences. 
                    As this type design is very specific for individual situations, 
                    the needs and wants of the individual are paramount in this area of interior design. 
                    The interior designer may work on the project from the initial planning stage or may work on the 
                    remodelling of an existing structure. 
                    It is often a very involved process that takes months to fine-tune and create a space with the vision of the client.
