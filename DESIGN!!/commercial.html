            While residential interior designers focus on homes, commercial interior designers conceptualize 
            spaces for businesses. 
            This would include hotels and lounges, restaurants and retail spaces, offices, banks, theaters, 
            hospitals and examination rooms, libraries, schools, country clubs, spas, shopping malls, and everything in between.

            Is the distinction really that important? Yes! Homes and businesses have different design needs. 
            Residential interior design is all about creating welcoming and livable spaces for homeowners, 
            whereas commercial design seeks to increase functionality and elevate style for financial gain.
            Whether it’s a luxury hotel developer or a small business owner, 
            it is up to the commercial interior designer to translate the client’s vision in ways 
            that are practical, profitable, and of course, chic. 
            Commercial interior designers are trained to prioritize functionality and safety 
            without sacrificing style or aesthetics.

                Commercial interior designers are trained to prioritize functionality and safety without sacrificing style or aesthetics. 
                For example, a luxury hotel needs to accommodate a certain amount of guests if it wants to maximize profits. 
                But in order to do so, the hotel has to impress guests with spacious rooms, lavish bathrooms, and breathtaking views. 
                It should wow guests with its lobby, 
                and make room for high-end amenities including spas, saunas, gyms, outdoor spaces, pools, and a restaurant and bar.
